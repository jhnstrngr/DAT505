# DAT505
This project is a conceptual audiovisual web album for the iconic Pink Floyd Album "The Dark Side Of The Moon".

The playlist is displayed on the left side of the screen with a normal audio player above that lets you pause, play and change the volume.

It is entirely controlled using the mouse, you can drag to move and use the scroll wheel to zoom in/out.

(UNABLE TO UPLOAD TO CODEPEN BECAUSE OF FILE TYPE RESTRICTIONS)
